Usage
-----

### Watch node

Watches for file events on Dropbox.

By default all file events are reported, but the filename pattern can
be supplied to limit the events to files which have full filenames
that match the glob pattern.

The event messages consist of the
full filename in `msg.payload` property, the filename
in `msg.file`, the event type in `msg.event` and
the <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js">dropbox.js</a>
API <a href="http://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Http/PulledChange.html">PulledChange</a>
object in `msg.data`.

### Input node

Downloads content from Dropbox.

The filename on Dropbox is taken from the node **filename**
property or the `msg.filename` property.

The downloaded content is sent as `msg.payload` property. If the download
fails `msg.error` will contain an error object.

### Output node

Uploads content to Dropbox.

The filename on Dropbox is taken from the node **filename** property or the `msg.filename` property.

You can pass in content either as a filename by setting the **localFilename** field or
`msg.localFilename` property, or you can pass in content directly using `msg.payload`.

The file will be uploaded to a directory on Dropbox called `Apps/{appname}/{appfolder}`
where {appname} and {appfolder} are set when you set up the Dropbox application key and token.
