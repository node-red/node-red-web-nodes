node-red-node-openweathermap
============================

A <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> node that gets the
weather report and forecast from OpenWeatherMap.

Install
-------

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

        npm install node-red-node-openweathermap

Usage
-----

Two nodes that get the weather report and forecast from OpenWeatherMap.

**Note:** An API key is required to use these nodes. To obtain an API key
go to <a href="http://openweathermap.org/appid" target="_new">OpenWeatherMap</a>.


### Input Node

Fetches the current weather or 5 day forecast at a location specified by `city and country` or
`latitude and longitude` every 10 minutes - and outputs a **msg** if something has changed.

### Query node

Accepts an input to trigger fetching the current weather either
from a specified `city and country` or `latitude and longitude` or passed in on

    msg.location.city and msg.location.country
        or
    msg.location.lat and msg.location.lon

### Results

Current conditions will return

  - **description** - a brief verbal description of the current weather for human reading.
  - **weather** - a very short description of the current weather.
  - **icon** - the weather icon code for the current conditions.
  - **id** - the id given to the current weather by OpenWeatherMap
  - **tempc** - the current ground temperature at that location in Celsius.
  - **tempk** - the current ground temperature at that location in Kelvin.
  - **humidity** - the current relative humidity at the location in percent.
  - **windspeed** - the current wind speed at the location in metres per second.
  - **winddirection** - the current wind direction at the location in meteorological degrees.
  - **location** - the name of the location from which the data was sourced.

5 day Forecast will return a 5 part array, each with

 - **dt** - epoch timestamp
 - **pressure** - in hPa
 - **hunidity** - in %
 - **speed** - wind speed in metres per second
 - **deg** - wind direction in degrees
 - **clouds** - cloudiness in %
 - **temp** - an object with various temperatures in degC,
   - day, min, max, night, eve, morn
 - **weather** - an object with some misc. data,
   - description, icon, main, id



The node also sets the following properties of **msg.location**.

  - **lat** - the latitude of the location from which the data was sourced.
  - **lon** - the longitude of the location from which the data was sourced.
  - **city** - the city from which the data was sourced.
  - **country** - the country from which the data was sourced.

Finally, the node sets:

  - **msg.time** - the time at which the weather data was received by OpenWeatherMap.
  - **msg.data** - the full JSON returned by the API. This is VERY rich...
